# StaticComp

### Solo Project
## Abstract

In this Mod 2 solo project, we were asked to match a comp while creating a custom theme for the website. I've chosen to create a tattoo portfolio website where users can check out their favorite tattoo artists and book with them. This comp allows the user to open and close the side navigation bar.

## Local Set-Up Instructions
- From the repo click the code button and copy the SSH link.
- Open terminal by pressing command + space bar, and search for terminal
- Inside of you terminal type `git clone` and then paste the ssh link. It should look like this: [git@github.com:KarimAl-Rashdan/StaticComp.git](git@github.com:KarimAl-Rashdan/StaticComp.git)
- In your terminal type `cd StaticComp`
- run `open index.html` to see the browser page

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Github  Pages
## Project Goals / Wins / And Future Features
- Feeling more comfortable with CSS and FlexBox
- I was able to utilize interface icons, create my own assets files, and create pie & bar graphs using CSS
- I would like to study web design, and revisit this project to edit the color palette and background
